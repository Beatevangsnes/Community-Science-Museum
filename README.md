## Description

The Community Science Museum Website Project is my first school assignment after embarking on my frontend development journey.
The primary goal of this project was to design a website that appeals to the core target audience, consisting of primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children. The website aimed to attract middle school pupils and their parents by providing an informative and engaging online experience, enticing them to visit the museum in person.
